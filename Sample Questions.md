1. How does React render components to the DOM?

   - React uses a virtual DOM 

   - where a "virtual" representation of a UI is stored and sync with the actual DOM using the library ReactDOM

     

2. When does react require a "key" and why?

   - example when there is an array of data, and you map through the data and render the individual elements, a key is required
   - identifiers given to items within an array

   - react can track if that item has changed 

     

3. What is JSX?

   - JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript
   - allows us to write HTML-like syntax that compiles to React elements

   - React does not required JSX

     

4. Why is react considered faster than direct DOM manipulation 

   - react only re-renders elements that changes state rather than re-rendering the entire page

     

5. What is the virtual DOM?

   

6. Browsers cannot read JSX. How can the browser read JSX?

   - JSX is converted back to Javascript using babel, which is included in the react-scripts which is part of the create-react-app
